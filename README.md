# CNN-cat-and-dog
Made a convolutional neural network which would help distinguish between a cat and dog based off their features.
Made use of keras and tensorflow library.
Used keras library for rescaling, zooming, etc the images to oncrease the dataset size to as to increases accuracy by accounting features more robustly.
It makes use of convolutional layers which are two layers dense(deep) and then flattened the output.
It uses the relu activation function for the hidden layers and the sigmoid function for giving the output in the binary form which is necessary in the classification problem.
