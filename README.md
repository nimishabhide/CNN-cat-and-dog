# CNN-cat-and-dog
Made a convolutional neural network which would help distinguish between a cat and dog based off their features.
It makes use of convolutional layers which are two layers dense(deep).
It uses the relu activation function for the hidden layers and the sigmoid function for giving the output in the binary form which is necessary in the classification problem.
